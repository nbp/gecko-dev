Bug 900784:
 [X] Add a preference to enable/disable the bytecode cache.
 [X] Add test cases, including testing RestartLoad.
 [X] Hook the saving of bytecode to be executed after the onload event:
 [ ] Add telemetry probes to measure the failure cases. (number of restarts)
 [X] Add the build-id number as part of the alternate data Mime type. (to avoid decoding failures)
 [ ] Add the request version number as part of the alternate data Mime type. (to avoid decoding failures)
